# MagicGApps 7.1.x for ARM & ARM64

Disclaimer: this package may not be suitable for everyone, due to its striped down nature. Only the core GApps features are icluded. This is even lighter than the Pico GApps package itself!

***
Full Google Framework
Core syncing APKs (i.e., Google Play Services, SetupWizard, Google Play Store)
Battery & data saving patches (hungry GApps removed from "power whitelist")
Dynamic installer (single package for both ARM & ARM64)
